// Explanation of this file and all the SN_ constants thing around the project files
//
// The function below patches the patcher so that, first I don't need to pass the addresses as parameters to every
// function on this program, and second and MUCH more important (the actual main reason): when the EXE calls this file's
// strings and functions, they already have the correct addresses on them and there is no need to pass addresses as
// parameters from the EXE to the new functions (or else I'd need a wrapper for every function I'd want to patch on the
// EXE that would go see where this block is allocated with a stored address on the code section of the EXE, do a little
// math to get this file's sections, and send them to the new functions inside this file --> wtf; so the new way is MUCH
// better).
// How does the program know how to patch itself? Wherever an address known only at run-time is needed, I place a
// special constant (SN_-started constant) and the program at run-time, looks for those constants and replaces them all
// in memory. So the patcher iterates its own memory and patches itself. Therefore the values must be unique, else it
// would patch something else. So I've chosen (in little endian - important): 12345678h and small variants of those.
// This also means there can be no opimizations ANYwhere where these values are. Volatile helps on that on PatchUtils,
// for example.
// How does the program not patch itself when comparing values? Because I'm putting the patcherPatcher() function with a
// constant parameter (a base value, SN_BASE) which it then sums to macros to get the final value to compare, every time
// it wants to compare values. It's not a decent idea, but it works, because Open Watcom doesn't optimize it, so I guess
// it's good enough.
// EDIT: thinking a bit more, I think the idea is the same as relocations ("dynamic relocations"? xD). I just don't have
// a table nor I want to make one xD - my way is kind of simpler, I just have to hope (ğŸ˜‚) that the Special Numbers are
// never used anywhere else than where I put them.

// This function must NOT use ANY other function from this project to achieve its goal. It must be all internal to this
// file. That way, for sure it's not using something that needs to be replaced (which can only happen after this
// function ends its job successfully and without external help).

// Implementations taken from the EXEPatchUtils functions, following the strict aliasing rules (always using a char*).
