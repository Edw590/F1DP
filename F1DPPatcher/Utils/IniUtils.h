/**
 * @brief Looks for a property value in an INI file given a key, possibly a given section name, and possible a given
 * Special Section name (which are sections specifically for Fallout 1 DOS Patcher, which can contain normal INI
 * sections).
 *
 * It ignores any whitespaces before and after the key and value. It does NOT ignore whitespaces between other
 * characters (like "value 1   		=   my name       3   	", the key is "value 1" and the value is "my name       3").
 * It also detects inline-comments and ignores them, and is able to search by sections (which can contain ; and =, but
 * it's not recommended as that's not supposed to be there and I'm only allowing it because I don't want to be more time
 * coding this parser...).
 * Finally, it is not case sensitive on the section (special or not) and property keys. The property values will be
 * returned exactly as written on the file.
 * Special Sections start with "[>F1DP-" and end with "<]", and have the same characteristics as Sections do.
 *
 * ATTENTION: the attribute is_main_ini of FileInfo is NOT modified. That must be modified manually externally.
 *

 *                               the given INI has *is_main_ini* set to false, this parameter will be used as if it were
 *                               set to NULL
 * @param prop_section_name the name of the section where the given key is, or NULL to ignore
 * @param prop_key the name of the key to get the value from
 * @param def_value a string to copy to *prop_value* in case the key is not found, or NULL to don't touch in
 *                  *prop_value* in that case
 * @param prop_value an array with enough space to copy the found value to
 * @param ini_info a pointer to the information of the INI file where to search the value in
