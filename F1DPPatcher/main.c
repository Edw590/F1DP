// This could use some optimizations, but it will only run once every game start. So no big deal being a bit slower,
// but more readable xD. For example the while loop could have the condition put outside, but that's one more variable
// on the beginning of realMain() and that's a mess (I also don't want to create scopes just for that - no need).

// WARNING: I'm not paying much attention to how much of the stack I'm using... This MUST be loaded right after main()
// starts on the game, before more functions are called and the stack starts to get more full.

// WARNING 2: ALL GLOBAL VARIABLES MUST BE INITIALIZED AND ---NEVER--- UNINITIALIZED!!!!!! Else, it will go to a segment
// which is not on the file, and hence, can't be copied and, therefore, allocated.
// This is also just because I don't want to be appending NULL bytes or hard-coding a number on the Loader for it to
// always allocate space for the uninitialized data section. So just initialize everything (easy thing to do anyways).

// WARNING 3: NO SWITCH CASES MUST BE IN THIS ENTIRE PROJECT!!!!!! For those, there are things called Jump Tables. They
// use absolute addresses --> no way. Use IF statements ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
